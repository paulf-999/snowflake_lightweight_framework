## 1. High-level summary

The framework consists of using a `Makefile` to orchestrate the execution of `SnowSQL` commands.

Where the input args for the `Makefile` come from `env/env_example.json`.

## 2. Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

| Mandatory / Optional | Prerequisite | Steps |
| -------| -----------| ------------------|
| Mandatory | Install [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html) and configure a SnowSQL [*named connection*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-start.html#using-named-connections) | Once you've created a [*named connection*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-start.html#using-named-connections), update the value of the corresponding key `SnowflakeNamedConn` within `env/env_example.json`. |
| Optional | Create a user for CI/CD activities | If you're looking to carry out CI/CD activities, you'll need to create a corresponding service role.<br/>The templated SQL script to create this user can be found within:<br/>`account_objects/user/v1_create_pipeline_deploy_user.sql` |

---

## 3. How-to run

The steps involved in building and executing involve:

1) Updating the input parameters within `env/env_example.json` (described below)
2) and running `make`!

---

#### Input parameters (within `env/env_example.json`)

Described below are the input parameters (from the file `env/env_example.json`) that are required for the framework:

| Parameter | Description | Example | Mandatory |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Program` | * Accronym to describe the program of work<br/>* Used extensively to prefix DB/account objects<br/>* Note: hyphens, spaces or underscores aren't allowed for this value | `DFP` <br/>(accronym for 'Data Foundations Project') | Yes  |
| `Environment` | * The environment type<br/>* Used extensively, to prefix DB/account objects | `NP` (Non-Prod), `PROD` | Yes |
| `S3BucketEg` | * The name of the S3 bucket to load data into Snowflake from | `s3://eg-s3-bucket` | Yes |
| `AwsAccountId` | A 12-digit number that uniquely identifies an AWS account | `123456789012` | Yes |
| `SnowflakeNamedConn` | * Refers to the value of a Snowflake 'named connection'<br/>* [`snowsql`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html) stores connection details within a configuration file<br/>* The default path to the configuration file is `~/.snowsql/config`<br/>* See [Snowflake Named Connections](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-start.html#using-named-connections) | `eg_sf_profile` | Yes |
| `SnowflakeIAMRoleName` | * Name of the AWS IAM role to be created by the framework<br/>* Role to be used to allow comms between S3 bucket(s) and Snowflake | `${PROGRAM}-snowflake-access-role` | Yes |
| `SnowflakeVPCID` | * The ID of the VPC in which Snowflake resides within<br/>* Retrieved by running the Snowflake query:<br/>`SELECT system$$get_snowflake_platform_info();`<br/>* `ACCOUNTADMIN` privileges are required to run this query | `vpc-123f12e1` | Yes |

---

## 4. Additional info - overview of execution steps

Described below are the main execution steps / flow of the framework:

1) Creates account objects needed to support the above architecture, including:
    * Databases for each of the zones highlighted above (raw, curated, analytics)
    * A custom role hierarchy (shown below), to exercise RBAC across all of the account/database objects created
    * Corresponding warehouses, resource monitors and 'custom admin-roles', to own account-level operations, e.g. to create a Snowflake Task, Storage Integration object etc.
2) Create database objects needed to support the above architecture (more to follow.)
